## Description
> Hexen	"Hexen is an online, multiplayer, deck-building adventure game. In Hexen, the world has a 'heartbeat' of ten second intervals for players to take their next trun. Players travel the world of hexen, completing quests, crafting new cards, and jockying for control of regions with their friends.

> Architecturally, the game operates much like a live chat application. Each region (over 600 regions!) is akin to a chat room that manages the game for the players in that region, and is controlled by it's own private Virtual Machine (enabled by Elixir BEAM)."
